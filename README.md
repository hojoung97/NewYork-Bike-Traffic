NewYork Bike Traffic Data Analysis


Data Science project analyzing NewYork bike traffic on 4 major bridges in NewYork.
Dataset is found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-east-river-bicycle-crossings) or you can also refer to [bike_data.csv](bike_data.csv)

## Problems in Question
1. You want to install sensors on the bridges to estimate overall traffic across all the bridges. But you only have enough budget to install sensors on three of the four bridges. Which bridges should you install the sensors on to get the best prediction of overall traffic?

2. The city administration is cracking down on helmet laws, and wants to deploy police officers on days with high traffic to hand out citations. Can they use the next day's weather forecast to predict the number of bicyclists that day?

3. Can you use this data to predict whether it is raining based on the number of bicyclists on the bridges?
